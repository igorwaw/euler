# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of programming puzzles available at https://projecteuler.net/

I tried to solve some puzzles years ago - in 2010 I think. The code was originally written in Python2 and converted to Python3.
It's probably terrible. I'm only uploading it here so that I can return to it some day,
